## Submission Instructions

### Overview
In  my time as a homeowner I have learned many new skills while tackling issues while also coming across issues I have no desire to mess with. My goal is to create
a web application that could act as  centralized hub for both contractors and those seeking certail skills for renovation/repair to get connected with each other to
find the right people for the right tasks.

As a purchaser of services it would allow them to browse and find people witht he skills needed as well as perform research on past quality. As a contractor who
has developed these skills it would serve as a place to keep a profile of their skills and find potential business.

### Features
User Signup-Page that would allow both purchasers and contractors to sign in and create a profile page listing skills or skills needed.
Search Feature-Users will be able to search for particular skills or people
Payment- Purchasers will be able to make credit card payments to contractors.
Profiles Pages- Each user will have a profile page which they can edit as new skills are developed or new jobs are needed.

### Technologies
C#
Bootstrap visual
Stripe (payment)
Microsoft Visual Studio

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn how to integrate an API to allow credit card payments. I would also like to learn to integrate bootstrap for better overall visuals upon
completion of the functionality.
